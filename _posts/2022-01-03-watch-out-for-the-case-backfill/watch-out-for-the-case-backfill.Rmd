This week, COVID-19 cases have continued to rise in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (4119 observed cases on December 28, 2021), despite <a href="https://policylab.chop.edu/covid-lab-mapping-covid-19-your-community">incidence modelling</a> that predicted a peak closer to 680 cases/day. I wanted to understand how <b>case backfill</b>, the process of updating COVID-19 daily case counts for up to a week after the initial daily case counts are recorded, might impact estimates of the COVID-19 reproductive number (R<sub>t</sub>) and predictions of future COVID-19 incidence based on R<sub>t</sub>. During the winter holiday season, short staffing may result in data entry and transfer delays that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/11/22/us/covid-data-holiday-averages.html">increase the impact of case backfill</a>. To understand the <b>holiday backfill effect</b>, I compared the COVID-19 case data available for Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 22 December 2021 to the case data available today, 3 January 2022:  
  
```{r p_combined, eval=TRUE, autodep=TRUE, fig.align='center', out.width='90%'}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "p_covid_backfill_combined_tp.png")

```
  
In the top panel, the comparison of incidence data demonstrates that <b>case backfill</b> significantly increased cases in the week prior to December 22, 2021. In the bottom panel, the effect of this missing data to skew R<sub>t</sub> below 1 can be seen. (R<sub>t</sub> was estimated using a mean serial interval of 2.2 days (SD 0.8 days), based on the best available data on the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.25.21268301v1">Omicron variant</a>, via the <a href="">EpiEstim R package</a>. The 95% confidence interval for R<sub>t</sub> is shown).
  
The same model for R<sub>t</sub> based on the most recent available data again suggests that R<sub>t</sub> is trending down... but this should not be cause for excess optimism in light of the <b>holiday backfill effect</b> seen last week.
