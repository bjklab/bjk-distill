```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

I had reason to go back to a _C. difficile_ clinical update that I gave recently. Now slightly out-of-date, but perhaps still useful:   
  
  
```{r xaringan_extra_cdiff_update, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE}

xaringanExtra::embed_xaringan(url = "https://bjklab.github.io/C-diff-clinical-update-2019/slides.html",
                              ratio = "16:9")



```
