  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Little is known about temporal changes in nasal
              bacteria in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). We examined
              longitudinal changes in the nasal microbiome in association with
              relapse in GPA patients. METHODS: Bacterial 16S gene sequencing
              was performed on nasal swabs of 19 patients with GPA followed
              longitudinally for a total of 78 visits, including 9 patients who
              developed a relapse and 10 patients who remained in remission.
              Relative abundance of bacteria and ratios between bacteria were
              examined. Generalized estimating equation models evaluated the
              association between bacterial composition and 1) disease activity
              and 2) PR3-ANCA level, adjusting for medications. RESULTS:
              Corynebacterium and Staphylococcus were the most abundant
              bacterial genera across all nasal samples. Patients with
              quiescent disease maintained a stable ratio of Corynebacterium to
              Staphylococcus across visits. In contrast, in patients who
              experienced a relapse, a significantly lower ratio occurred at
              the visit prior to relapse, followed by a higher ratio at time of
              relapse (adjusted P < 0.01). Species-level analysis identified an
              association between higher abundance of nasal Corynebacterium
              tuberculostearicum and relapse (adjusted P = 0.04) and higher
              PR3-ANCA levels (adjusted P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: In GPA,
              significant changes occur in the nasal microbiome over time and
              are associated with disease activity. The occurrence of these
              changes months prior to onset of relapse supports a pathogenic
              role of nasal bacteria in GPA. Our results uphold existing
              hypotheses implicating Staphylococcus as an instigator of disease
              and have generated a novel finding involving Corynebacterium as a
              potential mediator of disease in GPA.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVE: Tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation provide
              essential support for patients with respiratory failure, but the
              course of mechanical ventilation may be complicated by adverse
              ventilator-associated events (VAEs), which may or may not be
              associated with infection. We sought to understand how the
              frequency of subglottic suction, an indicator of the quantity of
              sputum produced by ventilated patients, relates to the onset of
              all VAEs and infection-associated VAEs. DESIGN: We performed a
              case-crossover study including 87 patients with VAEs, and we
              evaluated 848 days in the pre-VAE period at risk for a VAE.
              SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Critically ill patients were recruited
              from the medical intensive care unit of an academic medical
              center. METHODS: We used the number of as-needed subglottic
              suctioning events performed per calendar day to quantify sputum
              production, and we compared the immediate pre-VAE period to the
              preceding period. We used CDC surveillance definitions for VAE
              and to categorize whether events were infection associated or
              not. RESULTS: Sputum quantity measured by subglottic suction
              frequency is greater in the period immediately prior to VAE than
              in the preceding period. However, it does not discriminate well
              between infection-associated VAEs and VAEs without associated
              infection. CONCLUSIONS: Subglottic suction frequency may serve as
              a valuable marker of sputum quantity, and it is associated with
              risk of a VAE. However, our results require validation in a
              broader population of mechanically ventilated patients and
              intensive care settings.",

               estimate quantitative viral load, with the goal of targeting
               isolation precautions for individuals with COVID-19 and guiding

               quality can alter the Ct values obtained from SARS-CoV-2

               (NP) swab quality impacts clinical SARS-CoV-2 test sensitivity.
               Methods: We performed amplification of a human gene target
               ($\beta$-actin) in parallel with a clinical RT-PCR targeting the
               SARS-CoV-2 ORF1ab gene for 1311 NP specimens collected from
               patients with clinical concern for COVID-19. We evaluated the
               relationship between NP specimen quality, characterized by high
               Ct values for the human gene target $\beta$-actin Ct, and the
               probability of SARS-CoV-2 detection via logistic regression, as
               well as the linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and
               $\beta$-actin Ct. Results: Low quality NP swabs are less likely
               to detect SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio 0.654, 95\%CI 0.523 to 0.802).
               We observed a positive linear relationship between SARS-CoV-2
               and $\beta$-actin Ct values (slope 0.169, 95\%CI 0.092 to
               0.247). COVID-19 disease severity was not associated with
               $\beta$-actin Ct values. Conclusions: Variability in NP specimen
               quality accounts for significant differences in the sensitivity
               of clinical SARS-CoV-2 assays. If unrecognized, low quality NP
               specimens, which are characterized by a low level of amplifiable
               human DNA target, may limit the application of SARS-CoV-2 Ct

  abstract = "Background: Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) is the
              leading cause of antibiotic-associated and health care-associated
              diarrhea in humans. Recurrent CDI (R-CDI) occurs in ~20\%-30\% of
              patients with CDI and results in increased morbidity, mortality,
              and hospital costs. Genomic analyses have shown overlap of C.
              difficile isolates from animals and people, suggesting that a
              zoonotic reservoir may contribute to recurrence. The objective of
              this study was to determine whether pet ownership is a risk
              factor for recurrence of CDI. Methods: We conducted a
              case-control study among patients with recurrent CDI (cases; n =
              86) and patients with nonrecurrent CDI (controls; n = 146).
              Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine
              the association between recurrence of CDI and pet ownership while
              accounting for patient-level risk factors. Results: Pet ownership
              was not significantly associated with recurrence of CDI (odds
              ratio [OR], 1.02; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.72; P =
              0.965) among all patients (n = 232). However, among the subset of
              patients with community-associated or community-onset health care
              facility-acquired CDI (n = 127), increasing contact with pets was
              increasingly protective against recurrence: for every point
              increase in a pet contact score (out of 7 possible points), the
              odds of recurrence decreased by 14\% (OR, 0.86; 95\% CI,
              0.74-1.00; P = 0.051). Conclusions: Close interactions with pets
              appear protective against the recurrence of community-acquired
              CDI. A potential mechanism may involve beneficial contributions
              to the microbiota of pet owners afflicted with CDI, as has been
              observed for other conditions such as atopy, obesity, and food
              allergies. However, more research is needed to understand the
              interactions between pets, owners, and their microbiota.",

              to be associated with distinct gut microbial features, including
              reduced bacterial community diversity and depletion of key taxa.
              In dogs, the gut microbiota features that define C. difficile
              colonization are less well understood. We sought to define the
              gut microbiota features associated with C. difficile colonization
              in puppies, a population where the prevalence of C. difficile has
              been shown to be elevated, and to define the effect of puppy age
              and litter upon these features and C. difficile risk. We
              collected fecal samples from weaned (n = 27) and unweaned (n =
              74) puppies from 13 litters and analyzed the effects of
              colonization status, age and litter on microbial diversity using
              linear mixed effects models. Colonization with C. difficile was
              significantly associated with younger age, and colonized puppies
              had significantly decreased bacterial community diversity and
              differentially abundant taxa compared to non-colonized puppies,
              even when adjusting for age. C. difficile colonization remained
              associated with decreased bacterial community diversity, but the
              association did not reach statistical significance in a mixed
              effects model incorporating litter as a random effect. Even
              though litter explained a greater proportion (67\%) of the
              variability in microbial diversity than colonization status, we
              nevertheless observed heterogeneity in gut microbial community
              diversity and colonization status within more than half of the
              litters, suggesting that the gut microbiota contributes to
              colonization resistance against C. difficile. The colonization of
              puppies with C. difficile has important implications for the
              potential zoonotic transfer of this organism to people. The
              identified associations point to mechanisms by which C. difficile
              colonization may be reduced.",

              stethoscopes. Two additional sets of practitioner stethoscopes
              were sampled before and after cleaning using standardized or
              practitioner-preferred methods. RESULTS: Bacterial contamination
              levels were highest on practitioner stethoscopes, followed by
              patient-room stethoscopes, whereas clean stethoscopes were
              indistinguishable from background controls. Bacterial communities
              on stethoscopes were complex, and community analysis by weighted
              UniFrac showed that physician and patient-room stethoscopes were
              indistinguishable and significantly different from clean
              stethoscopes and background controls. Genera relevant to
              healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) were common on
              practitioner stethoscopes, among which Staphylococcus was
              ubiquitous and had the highest relative abundance (6.8\%-14\% of
              contaminating bacterial sequences). Other HAI-related genera were
              also widespread although lower in abundance. Cleaning of
              practitioner stethoscopes resulted in a significant reduction in
              bacterial contamination levels, but these levels reached those of
              clean stethoscopes in only a few cases with either standardized
              or practitioner-preferred methods, and bacterial community
              composition did not significantly change. CONCLUSIONS:
              Stethoscopes used in an ICU carry bacterial DNA reflecting
              complex microbial communities that include nosocomially important
              taxa. Commonly used cleaning practices reduce contamination but
              are only partially successful at modifying or eliminating these
              communities.",

              criteria for sepsis that sought to improve predictive validity
              for mortality, it remains difficult to identify patients at
              greatest risk of death. We compared the utility of nine
              biomarkers to predict mortality in subjects with clinically
              suspected bacterial sepsis. DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The
              medical and surgical ICUs at an academic medical center.
              SUBJECTS: We enrolled 139 subjects who met two or more systemic
              inflammatory response syndrome (systemic inflammatory response
              syndrome) criteria and received new broad-spectrum antibacterial
              therapy. INTERVENTIONS: We assayed nine biomarkers ($\alpha$-2
              macroglobulin, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen,
              haptoglobin, procalcitonin, serum amyloid A, serum amyloid P, and
              tissue plasminogen activator) at onset of suspected sepsis and
              24, 48, and 72 hours thereafter. We compared biomarkers between
              groups based on both 14-day and total in-hospital mortality and
              evaluated the predictive validity of single and paired biomarkers
              via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.
              MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen-day mortality was 12.9\%,
              and total in-hospital mortality was 29.5\%. Serum amyloid P was
              significantly lower (4/4 timepoints) and tissue plasminogen
              activator significantly higher (3/4 timepoints) in the 14-day
              mortality group, and the same pattern held for total in-hospital
              mortality (Wilcoxon p $\leq$ 0.046 for all timepoints). Serum
              amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator demonstrated the best
              individual predictive performance for mortality, and combinations
              of biomarkers including serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen
              activator achieved greater predictive performance (area under the
              receiver operating characteristic curve > 0.76 for 14-d and 0.74
              for total mortality). CONCLUSIONS: Combined biomarkers predict
              risk for 14-day and total mortality among subjects with suspected
              sepsis. Serum amyloid P and tissue plasminogen activator
              demonstrated the best discriminatory ability in this cohort.",

  abstract = "OBJECTIVES: Skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) carry
              significant economic burden, as well as morbidity and mortality,
              especially when caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
              aureus (MRSA). Several new MRSA-active antibiotics have been
              developed, including semisynthetic glycopeptides (telavancin,
              dalbavancin and oritavancin). Of these, dalbavancin and
              oritavancin offer extended dosing intervals. METHODS: We
              performed a systematic review, network meta-analysis and cost
              analysis to compare the newer glycopeptides to standard care and
              to each other for the treatment of complicated SSTIs (cSSTI). A
              search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted in
              Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled
              Trials. We also developed a model to evaluate the costs
              associated with dalbavancin and oritavancin from the third-party
              payer perspective. RESULTS: Seven RCTs met the inclusion
              criteria. Network meta-analyses suggested that the clinical
              response to telavancin, dalbavancin and oritavancin was similar
              to standard care (odds ratio (OR) 1.09, 95\% confidence interval
              (CI) 0.90-1.33; OR 0.78, 95\% CI 0.52-1.18; and OR 1.06, 95\% CI
              0.85-1.33, respectively). Head-to-head comparisons showed no
              difference in clinical response between oritavancin and
              dalbavancin (OR 1.36; 95\% CI 0.85-2.18), oritavancin and
              telavancin (OR 0.98; 95\% CI 0.72-1.31) or dalbavancin and
              telavancin (OR 0.72; 95\% CI 0.45-1.13). Telavancin had a higher
              incidence of overall adverse events compared to standard care (OR
              1.33; 95\% CI 1.10-1.61). Compared to telavancin, there were
              fewer overall adverse events with dalbavancin (OR 0.58; 95\% CI
              0.45-0.76) and oritavancin (OR 0.71; 95\% CI 0.55-0.92). Studies
              were of high quality overall. Our cost analyses demonstrated that
              dalbavancin and oritavancin were less costly compared to standard
              care under baseline assumptions and many scenarios evaluated. The
              use of dalbavancin could save third-party payers $1442 to $4803
              per cSSTI, while the use of oritavancin could save $3571 to $6932
              per cSSTI. CONCLUSIONS: Dalbavancin and oritavancin demonstrate
              efficacy and safety comparable to standard care in well-designed
              RCTs and result in cost savings when standard care is treatment
              that covers MRSA.",

              antibiotic cure rates diminish with each recurrence of CDI. Fecal
              microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective therapy for
              recurrent FMT, which otherwise requires prolonged or indefinite
              antibiotic treatment. FMT is performed by introducing the fecal
              microbial community obtained from a healthy donor or pool of
              donors into the stomach, small intestine, or colon of a patient
              with CDI. Multiple clinical trials support the usefulness of FMT
              in treating recurrent CDI, and CDI treatment guidelines now
              include consideration of FMT at the third CDI recurrence.
              However, there remain challenges to incorporating FMT into
              clinical practice. First, methods of fecal bacterial community

              refractory CDI, particularly for severe and severe complicated
              cases, are uncertain. Third, the US Food and Drug Administration
              (FDA) considers FMT an investigational treatment. Fourth,
              insurance reimbursement for FMT usually falls short of FMT
              administration costs. In the setting of rising C difficile
              incidence and growing evidence for FMT efficacy, the demand for
              FMT has increased. However, uncertainty surrounding optimal FMT
              preparation and administration methods, FDA oversight, and

              FMT.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is a major
              contributor to respiratory failure requiring intubation and
              mechanical ventilation. LRTI also occurs during mechanical
              ventilation, increasing the morbidity and mortality of intubated
              patients. We sought to understand the dynamics of respiratory
              tract microbiota following intubation and the relationship
              between microbial community structure and infection. RESULTS: We
              enrolled a cohort of 15 subjects with respiratory failure
              requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation from the medical
              intensive care unit at an academic medical center. Oropharyngeal
              (OP) and deep endotracheal (ET) secretions were sampled within 24
              h of intubation and every 48-72 h thereafter. Bacterial community
              profiling was carried out by purifying DNA, PCR amplification of
              16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences, deep sequencing, and
              bioinformatic community analysis. We compared enrolled subjects
              to a cohort of healthy subjects who had lower respiratory tract
              sampling by bronchoscopy. In contrast to the diverse upper
              respiratory tract and lower respiratory tract microbiota found in
              healthy controls, critically ill subjects had lower initial
              diversity at both sites. Diversity further diminished over time
              on the ventilator. In several subjects, the bacterial community
              was dominated by a single taxon over multiple time points. The
              clinical diagnosis of LRTI ascertained by chart review correlated
              with low community diversity and dominance of a single taxon.
              Dominant taxa matched clinical bacterial cultures where cultures
              were obtained and positive. In several cases, dominant taxa
              included bacteria not detected by culture, including Ureaplasma
              parvum and Enterococcus faecalis. CONCLUSIONS: Longitudinal
              analysis of respiratory tract microbiota in critically ill
              patients provides insight into the pathogenesis and diagnosis of
              LRTI. 16S rRNA gene sequencing of endotracheal aspirate samples

              microbiome samples, termed beta diversity, can be measured by
              pairwise distance based on either presence-absence or
              quantitative species abundance data. PERMANOVA, a
              permutation-based extension of multivariate analysis of variance
              to a matrix of pairwise distances, partitions within-group and
              between-group distances to permit assessment of the effect of an
              exposure or intervention (grouping factor) upon the sampled
              microbiome. Within-group distance and exposure/intervention
              effect size must be accurately modeled to estimate statistical
              power for a microbiome study that will be analyzed with pairwise

              PERMANOVA power estimation tailored to marker-gene microbiome
              studies that will be analyzed by pairwise distances, which
              includes: (i) a novel method for distance matrix simulation that
              permits modeling of within-group pairwise distances according to
              pre-specified population parameters; (ii) a method to incorporate
              effects of different sizes within the simulated distance matrix;

  abstract = "In many studies of HIV replication, it is useful to quantify the
              number of HIV proviruses in cells against a background of
              unintegrated forms of the HIV DNA. A popular method for doing so
              involves quantitative PCR using one primer complementary to the
              HIV long terminal repeat (LTR), and a second primer complementary
              to a cellular Alu repeat, so that PCR product only forms from
              templates where a provirus is integrated in the human genome near
              an Alu repeat. However, several recent studies have identified
              conditions that alter distributions of HIV integration sites
              relative to genes. Because Alu repeats are enriched in gene rich
              regions, this raises the question of whether altered integration
              site distributions might confound provirus abundance measurements
              using the Alu-PCR method. Here modified versions of the HIV
              tethering protein LEDGF/p75 were used to retarget HIV integration
              outside of transcription units, and show that this has a
              negligible effect on Alu-PCR quantitation of proviral abundance.
              Thus altered integration targeting, at least to the degree
              achieved here, is not a major concern when using the Alu-PCR
              assay.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: In June of 2009, the World Health Organization
              declared the first influenza pandemic of the 21(st) century, and
              by July, New York City's New York-Presbyterian Hospital (NYPH)
              experienced a heavy burden of cases, attributable to a novel
              strain of the virus (H1N1pdm). METHODS AND RESULTS: We present
              the signs in the NYPH electronic health records (EHR) that
              distinguished the 2009 pandemic from previous seasonal influenza
              outbreaks via various statistical analyses. These signs include
              (1) an increase in the number of patients diagnosed with
              influenza, (2) a preponderance of influenza diagnoses outside of
              the normal flu season, and (3) marked vaccine failure. The NYPH
              EHR also reveals distinct age distributions of patients affected
              by seasonal influenza and the pandemic strain, and via available
              longitudinal data, suggests that the two may be associated with
              distinct sets of comorbid conditions as well. In particular, we
              find significantly more pandemic flu patients with diagnoses
              associated with asthma and underlying lung disease. We further
              observe that the NYPH EHR is capable of tracking diseases at a
              resolution as high as particular zip codes in New York City.
              CONCLUSION: The NYPH EHR permits early detection of pandemic
              influenza and hypothesis generation via identification of those
              significantly associated illnesses. As data standards develop and
              databases expand, EHRs will contribute more and more to disease
              detection and the discovery of novel disease associations.",

              Plasmodium falciparum asexual blood-stage infections. This
              apicoplast-resident pathway, distinct from the mammalian type I
              process, includes FabI. Here, we report synthetic chemistry and
              transfection studies concluding that Plasmodium FabI is not the
              target of the antimalarial activity of triclosan, an inhibitor of
              bacterial FabI. Disruption of fabI in P. falciparum or the rodent
              parasite P. berghei does not impede blood-stage growth. In
              contrast, mosquito-derived, FabI-deficient P. berghei sporozoites
              are markedly less infective for mice and typically fail to
              complete liver-stage development in vitro. This defect is
              characterized by an inability to form intrahepatic merosomes that
              normally initiate blood-stage infections. These data illuminate
              key differences between liver- and blood-stage parasites in their
              requirements for host versus de novo synthesized fatty acids, and
              create new prospects for stage-specific antimalarial
