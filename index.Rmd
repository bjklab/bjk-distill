Brendan J. Kelly, M.D., M.S., is an infectious diseases physician and epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. He researches the population biology of pathogens and microbial ecosystems in humans at high risk for bacterial infection. Dr. Kelly seeks to understand properties of microbial ecosystems that protect against bacterial pathogen colonization and infection, how microbial ecosystems are altered by antibiotics, and how they recover from infection and antibiotic treatment. He has performed large, clinical-translational studies to better understand two infections that occur commonly during critical illness: bacterial pneumonia and _C. difficile_ colitis. He has also investigated the use of fecal microbiota transplant (FMT) to aid recovery of the intestinal microbiota after _C. difficile_ treatment. His work has been supported by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
